i am curious about the rudiments of mind and mental illness; i am motivated by the prospect of enhancing behavioral health care, deepening therapeutic relationships, and improving lives; and i value reason, autonomy, curiosity, creativity, honesty, humility, compassion, and communion.

generally, i am interested in measuring and modeling how variation across people relates to clinical outcomes. to this end, i help build new explanatory and predictive models of symptoms (profiles and dynamics), as well as novel computational and statistical tools that enhance clinical insight and acumen — tools which improve clinicians' abilities to detect, understand, predict, and treat individual experiences of mental illness.

currently, i am an apprentice researcher at the <a href="https://www.brown.edu/carney/ccbs" target="_blank">carney center for computational brain science (ccbs)</a>. as a member of the ccbs team, i am honing my scientific and technical skills, contributing to basic and applied research agendas, and helping build an interdisciplinary program that bridges academia and industry. i studied mathematics, economics, and physics before gravitating toward the cognitive and clinical sciences, and i continue to think and probe across disciplines.

### current research interests
- temporal dynamics of and contextual relationships between mood, pain, and other somatic symptoms
- psychometrics, especially instrument validation and multivariate longitudinal measurement of individual differences
- methods: adaptive & optimal experimental design, active learning, dynamic treatment regimes (informed by time-varying observational data), multimodal data integraion & risk stratification

### other interests
- translational research tools 
- contemplative practice: indo-tibetan meditation, body scanning
- the arts: poetry, harmonica
- the outdoors: i love to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/benwandrew/" target="_blank">ride bikes and ski</a>, which i experience as communion with nature and friends, atop such elegant human ingenuity, powered by the marvel of metabolism, for the sake of fun and flourishing
